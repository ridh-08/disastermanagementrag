**Prompt Engineering with RAG for Disaster Evacuation Planning**
**Overview**
This project applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to improve disaster evacuation planning in India, focusing on earthquakes and wildfires. The goal is to assess how AI-generated outputs can be made more grounded, context-sensitive, and actionable through prompt engineering and retrieval integration.

**Core Objectives**
1. Design and evaluate RAG-based prompting frameworks for disaster-specific policies.
2. Compare RAG outputs (via Gemini) with non-RAG models (e.g., ChatGPT) on structure, realism, and contextual relevance.
3. Use RAG for stakeholder-aware simulations, multilingual awareness strategies, and policy drafts.

**Methodology**
1. Applied techniques: Prompt chaining, Tree of Thoughts, Chain-of-Verification, and Self-Consistency.
2. Used Gemini's API with retrieval augmentation to generate disaster-specific recommendations.
3. Evaluated policies across feasibility, cultural sensitivity, and stakeholder alignment.

**Key Findings**
1. RAG outputs were strong for concise, implementation-focused tasks but limited in multi-step reasoning.
2. Retrieval enhanced factual accuracy but required structured prompts to avoid generic or shallow responses.
3. RAG was most effective for refinement, logistics, and procedural clarity.

**Deliverables**
1. promptengineeringrag.ipynb: Implementation of RAG and comparative evaluations.
2. Final policy prompts and outputs for earthquakes and wildfires.
3. Comparative tables on ChatGPT vs RAG performance across modules.

**Limitations and Future Work**
1. RAG models struggled with depth and cultural nuance unless guided through chaining and structured templates.
2. Future improvements include real-time data grounding and domain-specific document retrieval pipelines.
